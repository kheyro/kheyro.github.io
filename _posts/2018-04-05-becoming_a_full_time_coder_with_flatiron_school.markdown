As a kid, I always loved computer, the first computer my parents bought was running Windows 95, I just loved digging around Windows settings or played game on it. Later, internet became more mainstream and accessible this is when I started going into coding (almost 16 years ago), I think I was 14 years old. I am not sure why, but I started learning **BASIC**, and I loved it. I loved how I could create thing out of nothing but line of coding and my mind, it was just small apps, or games with inputs, there was no user interface only command line. It is very satisfying to see your idea or code come to life and interact with it. After a while, it became quite boring as the only thing you could do was draw or realize command line code. 

This is when I started learning HTML and JS, it was another world, as I could actually have a clear user interface and expose it to the world. Back then, JS was mostly used to create fancy animation, alert box, dialog box, sliding text in title tag, sliding text in status bar... And all the HTML positionning was done using `table` tag. After that I learnt PHP, as I wanted to has persistent data, it was very hard to switch from learning HTML/JS to PHP. 

I never really thought of being a coder (profesionnally), to me it was just a hobby and I didn't know anyone in my family or my friends who were coders. Coming from an asian family, my career of choice were also narrowed down to being engineer (mostly mechanical engineer), dentist, doctor or pharmacist! I had no idea of what I wanted to do, I was just aiming for a master degree and having a good job. I ended up being graduated from a business school in finance...

But along my way, coding was always there, I was always coding on the side, I created an online ecommerce after graduating and lived off of it. I was taking care of every technical aspect of it. Coding, debugging, servers, domain name, analytics, etc... But I never fully considered myself I a coder, as I never fully comitted to being one. I learnt a lof of thing and deepen my understanding coding learning few thing here and there, about other language or framework. I also ended up leading a team of developer on a tech project from which I learnt a lot. 

After this last experience, I took a break to understand where I would go from now on. Looking back, it was just obvious that coding was part of me, and I should give it a real shot. I never fully considered myself as a great developer because I felt like I never studied the proper way, sure I read tons of books, articles, tutorials online... But it was just not enough to make myself confident enough about my coding skills. I started looking online for coding school, I had friends that attended GA, or hack reactor, but I couldn't attend on campus, they were just too expensive for me, and it was not worth it.

Then I stumble upon **Flatiron school** which was offering a great online curriculum with very flexible time managment at a decent price. It was the perfect mix!

So here I am learning coding from scratch trying to get solid foundation, and try to see where I am at with my current coding skills. I am actually done with the final portofolio project, I am waiting for the review. I absolutely loved the courses and lessons they flow smoothly and are very well organized. It also very well written and explained. I was afraid at first that it would not be beneficial for me as I had a coding background, but I learnt a lot going through the curriculum! 

Thinking about people who has absolutely no coding background, it must be very very hard. You must really be loving coding to go through it all! Your efforts will pay off, this is a very well designed course. Hats off to you guys!
